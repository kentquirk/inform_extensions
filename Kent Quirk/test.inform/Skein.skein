The Garage
An Interactive Fiction
Release 1 / Serial number 210324 / Inform 7 build 6M62 (I6/v6.34 lib 6/12N) SD

Garage
It's a typical garage, with exposed studs and assorted debris in the corners.

You can't quite believe what you're seeing. This is a Motobecane Super Mirage 10-speed bicycle, and it has to be at least 30 years old. This is the same brand and era as the first bike you ever owned. It probably just needs some tender loving care. And you're just right for the job.

On the old bike is the rear wheel (on which is the inflated black tire).

You can also see a front wheel, a flat red tire, a floor pump and an oil can here.
