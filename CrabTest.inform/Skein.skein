An Interactive Fiction by Kent Quirk
Release 1 / Serial number 210314 / Inform 7 build 6M62 (I6/v6.34 lib 6/12N) SD

sunporch
It's an open-air porch that is bordered by the ocean, only steps away. Apparently you can do that in this part of the world.

You see a small, generic, rectangular fishtank, containing what looks like salt water, with a sandy bottom and a plastic castle. Sitting on the castle is a hermit crab.

On the far wall is a low, metal file cabinet, painted black, with three drawers. The fishtank is on it.

You can also see a scallop shell, a conch shell and an empty wastebasket here.

It's a den that happens to open onto the ocean.

It is a small, generic, rectangular fishtank, containing what looks like salt water, with a sandy bottom and a plastic castle. Sitting on the castle is a hermit crab.

On the far wall is a low, metal file cabinet, painted black, with two drawers. There's a fishtank on it.

You can also see a scallop shell, a conch shell, a snail shell and a book here.

Soon, the hermit crab crawls over to inspect the scallop shell. It looks up in your direction, as if to say "what am I supposed to do with this flat thing?"  Then it climbs back to its place on the plastic castle.

The hermit crab seems hungry.

As soon as you get your hand out of the aquarium, the hermit crab clambers over to inspect the snail shell.  It pauses, then rushes into the new shell, disappearing inside. After a moment, it pops its head out. It already seems happier.
 Then it scrambles back to the top of the plastic castle.

&gt;[1] x tank
The fishtank is more than half full of salt water.

In the fishtank is a plastic castle.

&gt;[2] x crab
It's a small hermit crab wearing a tiny shell. It looks hungry. But maybe that's just the way crabs look.

The hermit crab seems to be wanting something.

&gt;[3] take castle
The hermit crab lifts its tiny gripping claw in a wordless challenge, and you back off. Perhaps it needs something from you.

&gt;[4] open top
You open the upper drawer of the file cabinet, revealing an ancient candy bar, some paper and a pencil.

&gt;[5] open bottom
You open the lower drawer of the file cabinet, revealing a jar of fishfood.

The hermit crab seems to need attention.

&gt;[6] take jar
Taken.

&gt;[7] open jar
You open the jar of fishfood, revealing some fish flakes.

&gt;[8] feed flakes to crab
(first taking the fish flakes)
As you shake the food on the water, the hermit crab seems to practically leap off its perch. The food quickly disappears and the crab scuttles back to its castle.

&gt;[9] put conch in tank
(first taking the conch shell)
Soon, the hermit crab climbs over to inspect the conch shell.  It leaves its own shell behind and crawls in. After a long pause, it climbs back into its original shell. You could swear you saw it shake its tiny head.
 Then it scrambles back to its place on the plastic castle.

The hermit crab is hanging awkwardly onto its shell.

&gt;[10] put snail in tank
(first taking the snail shell)
Immediately, the hermit crab climbs over to inspect the snail shell.  It pauses, then rushes into the new shell, disappearing inside. After a moment, it pops its head out. It already seems happier.
 Then it scuttles back to its home on the plastic castle.

The hermit crab appears to be gazing longingly toward the ocean.

&gt;[11] fill can from tank
(first taking the wastebasket)
You fill the wastebasket with salt water from the fishtank.

&gt;[12] pour can in ocean
You dump out the wastebasket into the ocean.

&gt;[13] fill can from tank
You fill the wastebasket with salt water from the fishtank.

&gt;[14] pour can in ocean
You dump out the wastebasket into the ocean.

&gt;[15] take castle
The hermit crab politely chitters to the floor of the aquarium.

Taken.

The hermit crab seems wistful.

&gt;[16] drop castle
Dropped.

The hermit crab appears to be gazing longingly toward the ocean.

&gt;[17] take tank
Taken.

The hermit crab seems wistful.

&gt;[18] pour tank in ocean
You dump out the fishtank into the ocean.

Immediately, the hermit crab crawls over to inspect the snail shell.  It pauses, then rushes into the new shell, disappearing inside. After a moment, it pops its head out.
 Then it clambers back to the top of the plastic castle.

*** Run-time problem P10: Since the crab food is not allowed the property "comfortable", it is against the rules to try to use it.

It's an open-air porch that is bordered by the ocean, only steps away. Apparently you can do that in this part of the world.

On the far wall is a low, metal file cabinet, painted black, with three drawers. The fishtank is on it.

You can also see a wastebasket of salt water, a scallop shell and a conch shell here.

Once you drop it in, the hermit crab chitters over to inspect the snail shell.  It pauses, then rushes into the new shell, disappearing inside. After a moment, it pops its head out. It already seems happier.
 Then it climbs back to its place on the plastic castle.

The hermit crab seems wistful.

It's an open-air porch that is bordered by the ocean, only steps away. Apparently you can do that here.

You see a small, generic, rectangular fishtank, containing what looks like salt water, with a sandy bottom and a plastic castle. Sitting on the castle is a hermit crab.

On the far wall is a low, metal file cabinet, painted black, with three drawers. The fishtank is on it.

You can also see an empty wastebasket here.

As soon as you get your hand out of the aquarium, the hermit crab scrambles over to inspect the snail shell.  It pauses, then rushes into the new shell, disappearing inside. After a moment, it pops its head out. It already seems happier.
 Then it clambers back to its place on the plastic castle.

[Your score has just gone up by two points.]

It's an open-air porch that is bordered by the ocean, only steps away. Apparently you can do that here.

You see a small, generic, rectangular fishtank, containing what looks like salt water, with a sandy bottom and a plastic castle. Sitting on the castle is a hermit crab.

On the far wall is a low, metal file cabinet, painted black, with three drawers. The fishtank is on it.

As soon as you get your hand out of the aquarium, the hermit crab climbs over to inspect the conch shell.  It leaves its own shell behind and clambers in. After a long pause, it scrambles back into its original shell. You could swear you saw it shake its tiny head.
 Then it climbs back to its place on the plastic castle.

It's a den that happens to open onto the ocean.

It is a small, generic, rectangular fishtank, containing what looks like salt water, with a sandy bottom and a plastic castle. Sitting on the castle is a hermit crab.

On the far wall is a low, metal file cabinet, painted black, with two drawers. There's a fishtank on it.

You can also see a scallop shell, an empty wastebasket and a book here.

It's an open-air porch that is bordered by the ocean, only steps away. Apparently you can do that here.

You see a small, generic, rectangular fishtank, containing what looks like salt water, with a sandy bottom and a plastic castle. Sitting on the castle is a hermit crab.

On the far wall is a low, metal file cabinet, painted black, with three drawers. The fishtank is on it.

You can also see a scallop shell, a conch shell and an empty wastebasket here.

The hermit crab barely fits into its shell.

It's an open-air porch that is bordered by the ocean, only steps away. Apparently you can do that here.

You see a small, generic, rectangular fishtank, containing what looks like salt water, with a sandy bottom and a plastic castle. Sitting on the castle is a hermit crab.

On the far wall is a low, metal file cabinet, painted black, with three drawers. The fishtank is on it.

You can also see a scallop shell, a conch shell and an empty wastebasket here.
